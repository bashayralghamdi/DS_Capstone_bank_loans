### target

  
what is limit of amount_loan that customer need depend on their data

```{r}

plot(loans$loan_amount,ylab = "loan amount")
boxplot(loans$loan_amount,main="Boxplot",horizontal = TRUE)

summary(loans$loan_amount)
#Q1 = 42000
#Q3 = 60000
#IQR = 60000 - 42000
```

This is upper value of loan_amount after that is outliers
```{r}
upper <- 60000+(60000 - 42000)*1.5 
upper
```
This is lower value of loan_amount before that is outliers

```{r}
lower <- 42000-(60000 - 42000)*1.5 
lower
```
How many outliers:
```{r}
#there are 3392 outliers
out <- boxplot.stats(loans$loan_amount)$out
length(out)
```
